# Emissary
Allows you to easily use Laravel Service Providers with Slim 3's DI container, as well as the associated facades. Emissary is inspired by [itsgoingd/slim-services](https://github.com/itsgoingd/slim-services) and is compatible with Slim 3.

This is very much a work in progress so use at your own risk.

## Installation

Installation is via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```bash
$ composer require mikescott/emissary "1.*"
```

# A working example with Illuminate/Database
```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Slim\App;
use Slim\Container;

$config = [
    'settings' => [
        'database.fetch' => PDO::FETCH_CLASS,
        'database.default' => 'mysql',
        'database.connections' => [
            'mysql' => [
                'driver' => 'mysql',
                'host' => 'mysql',
                'port' => 3306,
                'database' => '',
                'username' => '',
                'password' => '',
                'charset' => 'utf8',
                'collation' => 'utf8_unicode_ci',
                'prefix' => '',
                'strict' => false,
                'engine' => null,
            ],
        ]
    ]
];

$providers = [
    'Illuminate\Database\DatabaseServiceProvider'
];

$aliases = [
    'DB' => 'Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB'
];

$app = new App(new Container($config));

$app->add(new \mikescott\Emissary\Middleware($app, $providers, $aliases));

$app->get('/', function ($request, $response, $args) {
    # Illuminate/Database via facade
    $tables = DB::select('SHOW TABLES');
    var_dump($tables);

    # or via the container:
    $tables = $this->get('db')->select('SHOW TABLES');
    var_dump($tables);
});

$app->run();
```

## Custom Service Provider

### Example.php
```
<?php
namespace foo\Example;

class Example {
    public function hello()
    {
        return "Hello, world!";
    }
}
```

### ServiceProvider.php
See the [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.1/providers#writing-service-providers) for full details about creating service providers.

```
<?php
namespace foo\Example;

class ServiceProvider extends \Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider {
    public function register()
    {
        $this->app->singleton('example', function($app) {
           return new Example();
        });
    }
}
```

### Configuring Slim
```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Slim\App;
use Slim\Container;

$app = new App(new Container());

$app->add(new \mikescott\Emissary\Middleware($app, [
    'foo\Example\ServiceProvider'
]));

$app->get('/', function ($request, $response, $args) {
    $response->write($this->get('example')->hello());
    return $response;
});

$app->run();
```

When you run the app, "Hello, world!" should be output from the Example service.
